### 07/11/2023

Extend your previous homework with next features:
* Create 5 custom exceptions.
* Handle exceptions in 2 ways
* Use try-catch with resources.
* Log messages to the console, file

### Solution
Create the 5 custom exceptions added in the package exceptions. All of them
are used in the Employee.java class.
These are:
* PhoneNumberException: Threw if the phone number has more digits.
The throwPhoneNumberException(String employeePhoneNumber) uses it.
* NumberInNamesException: Threw if the name has numbers.
The throwNameException(String employeeName) uses it.
* LongEmployeeNameException: Threw if the name is too long.
* The throwNameException(String employeeName) uses it.
* EmployeeSpecialityException: Threw if the speciality doesn't exist. 
The throwEmployeeSpecialityException(String employeeSpeciality) uses it.
* EmailException: Threw if the email format is wrong.
The throwEmailException(String employeeEmail) uses it.

The method checkEmployeeData() in Employee class uses all these methods inside a
try-catch block to have exceptions handled in 2 ways.
The implementation could be seen in the main method example.

To use the try-catch with resources, we created the AutoClosableNoResource.java class
in exception package.
This implements the Autocloseable interface and overrides the close method.
The implementation could be seen in the main method example.

Log4j was implemented. The configuration file is in the main folder with the name:
* log4j2.xml

The configuration saves all warn and error messages in the HardwareStore.log.
All System.out.println() has been replaced with LOGGER.info(),LOGGER.warn()
or LOGGER.error().The only ones that are keep are the used to add white lines.
